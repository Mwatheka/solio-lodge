Solio Lodge is set amongst an epic wilderness of vast savannah dotted with scatterings of woodland and hills, the dream for Solio Lodge was to create a lodge that would convince people to explore the wild, even if they weren’t naturally intrepid, Solio Lodge wanted somewhere that would allow people to discover the wilderness, but without forgoing their comforts, to have an adventure, but one that wasn’t too far out of the comfort zone, Solio Lodge also thought about price, <b>Kenya Safaris</b> can often be very expensive and we wanted to keep the Solio lodge within the realms of possibility and when Solio Lodge opened August 2010 we think we managed to tick quite a few of those boxes, if there’s one thing about Solio Lodge it’s got to be the location, everywhere you turn, the rugged open spaces stretches into the distance far and wide, with only a spangly tree here, and a spiky bush there, here wildlife roams freely across the never-ending spaces, unhindered and unobstructed, Solio Lodge is a place of silence and solitude and a rare opportunity to be at one with nature and the animals that thrive here. Solio Lodge is a place where, like binary rings of a tree the founders - and each person thereafter - have served and left their mark, over the years the ripple effect created by Solio Lodge alumni has spread our ethos far and wide across the African continent and beyond, it is their efforts that have distilled the legacy of the past many years into the creation of the essence of <b>Kenya safari</b> spirit. At Solio Lodge classic meets modern, this Solio signature Lodge uncomplicated and really comfortable leaving nothing forgotten, you will get the feeling of all the comforts of a stylish safari lodge that is ideally situated to provide an insider’s view of the secrets of Africa. Classy and timeless – Solio represents a safari style that is inviting and restful.

              <h2> Solio Lodge the Experience </h2>
              <p style="text-align:justify;">
                The southern fringes of Laikipia, close to the foothills of the Aberdare range, Occupying the rolling plains between the Aberdare and Mount Kenya National Parks, <b>Solio Lodge</b> is a beacon in Kenya's conservation landscape and the country's pioneer in breeding <b>black rhinos</b>. Unlike many of younger <b>Kenya lodges</b>, Solio Lodge has not grown from an original ranch farmstead, Instead Solio Lodge was built from scratch in 2010 to provide a permanent base for the increasing numbers of visitors wanting to see Solio Lodge remarkable, long-horned black rhinos. Solio Lodge consists of a dramatic high-roofed, glass fronted central lounge and dining area and six well spaced-out cottages built in the same high graceful style with sweeping roofs of thatched tiles, the central building faces east on a clear morning to a dramatic sunrise over Mount Kenya with the cottages on either side in two wings of three. Facing the main lawn, the central areas which also serve as the Solio lodge reception is a fine place to gather before meals, the lawn is dominated by a freeform deck encircling the base of a venerable acacia tree and this is where breakfast and lunch are often served. Inside the lounge, there's a sit-up bar that gets most use when the lodge is full as well as contemporary artwork fascinating photos on the walls depict Solio Ranch's early days, At the back of the lounge, a dramatic curving staircase sweeps up to a mezzanine platform spanning the lounge where a small selection of gifts and crafts is for sale and comfy seating looks out from a veranda over the lawn. All Solio Lodge cottage size rooms can be set up as double or twin-bedded rooms. Each cottage has a design theme reflected in the art on the walls and the room décor. There's a really pleasing design coherence to all of them, with clean lines, comfortable chunky furnishings over the partly carpeted and partly polished cement floors, and each room has its own individual colour palette. The panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows allow natural light to flood each room and French windows give access to the low decks or lawns which front most of the cottages. The cottages each have a large lounge area with plenty of soft seating, set apart slightly from the bedroom area by a bar-console arrangement with reading material, a fridge and a music docking station for playing your music through the room's audio system. Each room has an elegant fireplace in the lounge, and the fire is usually lit, with acacia deadwood, ready for your return from the late afternoon activity. Another fireplace, in the bathroom, can be lit on request. With 24-hour mains electricity and charging points with UK-style sockets in all rooms, there's a solid sense of supreme comfort and contemporary style throughout. The cottage furthest to the south is cottage one Zebra which is usually considered the honeymoon suite furthest from the central area. Wildlife loves coming up to this room. Rooms two Banana Leaf and three Cheese plant are also on the south side of the central building. Of the six cottages, Cheese plant is the most disabled-friendly cottage, being closest to the main area, though none of them have any special adaptations. On the north side of the main building stands cottage #4 Strelitzia and then the adjoining family cottages the People rooms five and six. Although this adjoining pair is usually used as a huge family suite, other guests will often be upgraded here on arrival if it hasn't been taken. Separate groups of guests will never be booked here together, as the rooms share a main area. There are great views of the lodge waterhole from here. All the cottage bathrooms are enormous and feature deep, freestanding, bathtubs and twin wash basins. Some of the shower areas are floored with wood lattice and all have very high, waterfall-style showers with plenty of pressure. Ample hot water is provided by wood-fired boilers lit for each room, morning and evening. Unusually, the showers have glass walls on the garden side, allowing you to absorb the view and watch the wildlife while showering. Solio Game Reserve is Kenya's oldest private rhino sanctuary – a 76km² conservancy carved out of <b>Solio cattle ranch</b> in 1970. Initially a focus for the breeding of critically endangered black rhinos, it successfully started a <b>white rhino</b> breeding programme alongside the black rhinos and as numbers have burgeoned in the sanctuary rhinos of both species have often been translocated to other protected areas in Kenya, including <b>Lake Nakuru National Park, Ol Pejeta Conservancy</b> and Lewa Conservancy as a donation. <b>Solio Lodge</b> started a photographic database of its rhinos in 2004 and now every individual of both species can be monitored. There are currently more than 65 black rhino and more than 185 <b>white rhinos</b>. The extraordinary success of Solio Lodge conservation work means that <b>Solio</b> <b>Game Reserve</b> is chock-full of wildlife. You will see white rhinos in large herds often out on the open plains, and many of them with impressive horns. The instinctively shyer black rhinos are a shade less outgoing, but still quite easily spotted. These are the biggest of Solio's megafauna: there are <b>no elephants</b> at Solio, which has the benefit of protecting the splendid stands of yellow-barked fever trees that characterise the reserve. As well as large numbers of plains grazers, including impala, zebra and warthog, Solio has some northern species, including the rapier-horned Beisa oryx and smartly coated reticulated giraffe and many lions plus and the Solio Reserve has good numbers of leopards preying largely on the abundant impala. The opportunity to see some of Solio Lodge fantastic birdlife with more than 700 species having been spotted here, completes a spectacular wildlife experience. Although you can go out on a dawn game drive with the cooler and often slightly damp climate at Solio Lodge and abundant wildlife, morning activities generally start from 09:00 after an early breakfast. Game drives are run in comfortable 7-seater extended closed Land Cruisers with roof hatches conducted by a driver guide and a spotter. In the vehicles you have the option of sitting up high on roof-mounted seats for a better view which is good fun, The same vehicles are used for full-day excursions into Aberdare National Park the gate of which is a 30-minute drive from the Solio lodge, leaving the farmlands behind, you climb through dense mountain forest cut through by streams and inhabited by elephant, buffalo, giant forest hog and colobus monkeys. Above the forest, from about 2,400m, there's a dense zone of giant bamboo growing to 20m or more in height. And climbing above 2,800m you reach more open country, with tall, tussocky grassland and, above the tree line at about 3,000m, the region's famous Afro-alpine vegetation. This includes the same giant groundsel and ostrich plume plant or giant lobelia a strange, furry-looking giant herbs that can be found on Mount Kenya. The drive can include visits to the top of the Chania waterfall – and, if there's time, also to the Karura Falls lookout, with a stunning view of the Gura Falls across a huge, jungle-swathed chasm. Aberdare landscape and vegetation are beautiful and so varied and leopard’s sightings and plenty of buffalos, giant forest hogs (a real rarity) and many colobus and Skye’s monkeys. Other Solio Lodge activities include running, walking, horse-riding and cycling near the airstrip and in other safe areas outside the rhino sanctuary itself, you’ll be accompanied by safari guides, If you're feeling more sedentary the rooms have yoga mats and you can also order a massage and other treatments in your room (extra charges apply for those). Unusually, Solio Lodge offers very interesting back-of-house visits to the kitchen, vegetable and herb garden, stores and office area – neatly and securely organized in shipping containers. The short visit is encouraged and very worthwhile, testament to the high standards maintained here. This spectacularly conceived and beautifully integrated modern <b>bush lodge</b> with huge rooms is one of Kenya's very best places to stay, you will be instantly seduced by the attention to detail, the delicious meals, the glass-walled mega-showers that look out onto the savannah, the super-comfortable beds and the remarkable wildlife riches of the <b>Solio Game Reserve</b>, in particular the numerous black and white rhinos. Solio Lodge is around 60 minutes’ drive from <b>Nanyuki airstrip</b> or 5 minutes from Solio lodge own airstrip for private charters, The food quality at Solio is very high and one of the lodge's key experiences, the manager had a five-year stay in Italy and it shows in the attention to vibrant colors and flavors with vegetable and herb garden and the produce from Kenya's highland farms easily available you eat very well and in great variety, You can eat more or less when you prefer, but as a guideline, breakfast is usually served between 06:30 and 09:30, lunch between 13:00 and 14:30 and dinner between 19:30 and 20:30. Tea and coffee and biscuits or cakes are also on offer in the main area all afternoon or they can be bought to your room, as can tea or coffee with a morning wake-up call. Solo travelers will always be joined by the lodge manager for meals if appropriate. There are hot drink making facilities in the rooms but wake-up calls with hot drinks can also be arranged. Solio is home to an impressive population of white and black rhinos, and rides take place outside their sanctuary. Explore the woods and rolling plains and keep watch for a diversity of species, including the northern varieties of plains wildlife. The 6 well-spaced, east-facing cottages provide privacy and stunning sunrise views of Mount Kenya, while the graceful design, ample natural light and glass showers overlooking personal gardens create an ambience suitable for this luxury retreat. With its modern design and individually themed cottages, Solio Lodge was purpose-built for luxury. Panoramic windows and open fireplaces add wow-factor, while exploring the private conservancy makes for an exclusive experience. Children often play ball games – cricket, football, volley ball – in the grounds, and bush craft skills can be organized with some of the guides, as can torchlight walks in the grounds looking for small, nocturnal wildlife such as bushbabies and insects. Highchairs and baby cots are available. The gardens are fine for letting off steam and the impressive fauna in the rhino sanctuary is very easily seen, so game drives are packed with interest. As ever, very young children will need supervision at Solio lodge but older ones, from say 5 and up, should be fine if they behave responsibly. There’s a back-up generator for the occasional mains blackout. Solar water heating is planned though this won’t be feasible all year round. Hot water is supplied by wood- and briquette-burning boilers, with the briquettes partly supplied by the lodge’s own briquette maker, supplied with waste cardboard (other recycling includes tins and plastic bottles returned to Nairobi, kitchen waste to a pig farmer in the local town of Mweiga). Rooms are equipped with hair dryers. Cellphone network is available, and there's WiFi in the rooms. TV & radio - Borehole water is pumped up to tanks near the stables. This water is actually potable, but guests are nonetheless advised not to drink it and bottled water is provided. Solio staff have been on first aid and medical courses and are able to deal with minor problems. The lodge has a good range of first-aid equipment. Security is very good at Solio, with askaris at the lodge itself and Kenya Wildlife Service rangers and government General Service Unit officers in the surrounding ranch and sanctuary. There are fire extinguishers throughout the lodge. Staff have all done fire training.

          <h2> Solio The Story </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            In 1970, the Kenya Wildlife Service requested help from Solio, now a <b>Laikipia conservancy</b>, to temporarily house five black rhinos which had been left isolated due to prolific poaching. Black rhino populations in Kenya were suffering a horrific decline, plummeting from around 200,00 individuals in the 1960s to less than 300 two decades later. Happily, by 1973, Solio’s core fenced area was an established wildlife sanctuary and by 1980 had become home to 27 black rhinos from nine different areas of the country, as well as a founder herd of 16 white rhino re-located from South Africa. Solio’s rhino population swiftly prospered and as other private game reserves and National Parks grew more secure, Solio became the source for moving nucleus populations of rhino all over Kenya and even to Uganda and Malawi. Centrally involved in the translocation of the original rhinos into Solio was the family of one of the directors, Mikey Carr-Hartley. Having known and loved the ranch from a young age, when Mikey grew up and began to guide mobile safaris around Kenya, he enjoyed taking his guests to encounter the wildlife at Solio. With such an abundance of animals living in the sanctuary and so many majestic rhinos to encounter, photographic opportunities never disappointed. When, in 2010, an opportunity arose to create a <b>safari lodge</b> within private <b>Laikipia conservancy</b>, the decision was easy. Solio Lodge remains the only visitor accommodation on <b>Solio conservancy</b>, giving guests an exclusive experience. Although other visitors do have access to the sanctuary for game viewing, only Solio Lodge guests are able to spend the night and enjoy the unforgettable and unique experiences offered by the <b>safaris lodge</b>. Picture sunset cocktails against an iridescent African sky with a crash of rhinos just a few meters away. It really is one of the best places in the world to encounter wild rhinos. <b>Solio Conservancy</b> is home to over 200 black and white rhinos which live within a core 19,000-acre wildlife sanctuary. They are looked after by a team of dedicated rangers who protect them from poachers 24 hours a day. The core rhino sanctuary is surrounded by a 45,000-acre private ranch, making for an exclusive Laikipia Kenya game viewing experience. <b>Solio Lodge</b> offers exceptional levels of personalised service for the ultimate Laikipia safari experience. Guests enjoy a full board experience inclusive of all meals and drinks (excluding champagne and premium wines and spirits). This includes morning, afternoon and evening game drives, sundowners, bush meals, horse riding, cycling and walking. Spa treatments and some excursions are extra. Solio welcomes children of all ages; under two stay free and we offer a ‘baby listening’ service. We are able to cater for guests with limited mobility and special dietary requirements by prior arrangement.
          </p>
          <h2>Solio Lodge When to Go </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Solio Lodge is situated in the highland’s region in between the foothills of Mount Kenya and the slopes of the Aberdare National Park. As such, it has slightly higher altitudes, so pack a jumper for the cooler evenings and nights, although you can still expect warm, sunny days. The temperature remains relatively consistent throughout the year, although June, July and August are generally cooler months. The rains usually come in April and May and to a lesser extent in November, although global weather patterns are getting less predictable. Solio Lodge is open all year round apart from November, when it is closed for maintenance. Due to being located on a private Laikipia conservancy, Solio Lodge guests benefit from being able to explore the wilderness and wildlife on foot, horse-back and mountain bike, as well as on epic game drives. Wander across Solio Ranch on a guided nature walk, enabling you to get closer to some of the smaller creatures. Spot a myriad of bird life on a cycle ride or enjoy getting a little closer to some of our animals from horse-back. These activities take place just outside of the core rhino sanctuary area, but still within Solio Ranch where a diversity of wildlife can be encountered.

          <h2>Solio Lodge Explore </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
              <b>Solio Lodge Laikipia</b> provides a soothing retreat into the natural world of Kenya’s wonderful wildlife. Simple, chic and modern, Solio offers a fresh look on lodge design. Veering away from a traditional rustic lodge feel, it instead embraces a cleaner look with greenery as a theme throughout, embracing the surrounding vegetation and bringing the natural world in. Stepping through Solio Lodge’s main entrance, guests are immediately hit with a sense of space and light, alongside spectacular views out onto <b>Solio Game Sanctuary</b> through the floor-to-ceiling glass doors and windows. Open-plan spaces together with the high ceilings give a contemporary feel to the lodge which is dotted with plants and funky artwork. A wooden sundeck on the front lawn provides a peaceful dining experience for al fresco breakfasts and lunchtime feasts. Guests will find a bar, various indoor and outdoor seating and plenty of reading material scattered throughout the open plan mess area. Guests are welcome to visit Solio’s kitchen ‘shamba’ which is Swahili for small farm or field. Located just behind our family cottage, it’s bursting with herbs, veggies, lemons, a variety of salad leaves and more for our chefs to prepare fresh and nutritious meals. The soils are rich and fertile in this area of Kenya, perfect for nurturing a flourishing kitchen garden. Everything we grow is organic and pesticide-free, making for delicious farm to fork style cuisine for guests to enjoy, as well as helping us to be as sustainable as possible. Our veggies are nurtured by homemade compost made from our garden waste, whilst all organic waste is donated as feed to a local pig farm; it’s too tempting for the monkeys if we add it to our own compost. ood is very much a part of the guest experience at Solio Lodge Laikipia. Budding young chefs often enjoy a stroll around the shamba to see where their meals come from. If you’re interested in taking a look simply let one of our team know and the gardener will give you a tour. Our managers and kitchen team are passionate about coming up with new recipes which use seasonal ingredients from the garden. Vibrant healthy salad platters and delicious vegetable dishes won’t disappoint those who love to nourish their bodies. An assortment of bright orange, green and red chillis thrive in Solio’s shamba, so if you’re a chilli lover don’t miss Solio’s famous in-house chilli dressing or ‘pilipili hoho’ as it is known in Swahili; be careful as it packs quite a punch! The fragrant aroma of a fresh kafir lime leaf in our welcome drink is always appreciated by guests and homemade tea-time delights can be enjoyed with a freshly brewed cup of locally grown tea or coffee. We also have a lovely little boutique gift shop located near to the main entrance which you are welcome to visit at any time. It’s full of beautiful, handcrafted goodies made by Kenyan artisans so you can take a little piece of the safari home with you. <b>Solio Lodge</b> is easy to get to and can be found on Google Maps – you will spot it directly north of Nairobi in the valley between Mount Kenya National Park and the Aberdare National Park. The <b>conservation fees</b> you pay to stay at Solio Lodge directly support the running of Solio Conservancy and its successful rhino breeding programme, helping to protect this vulnerable species for future generations.

Proving once again its commitment to social investment, the Safari Collection has partnered up with SmileStar, a UK dental charity and Medical and Educational Aid to Kenya (MEAK) to provide free dental and eye treatments for the communities near Solio Lodge.
